# TheBigThree-Experiments
Experimenting with the big front-end three: HTML, CSS, and Javascript(vanilla and JQuery).

Next - I have to download and bash(windows, though linux is starting to grow on me with how much I see I can manipulate my databases) Jekyll so I can implement the files in this repository; effectively generating a database and creating a live static website via Github Pages.
